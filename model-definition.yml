  summary: >
    OpenUDM is a grid cell-based model which explores where future urban development might take place, subject to
    attractors, constraints and variable density of development.

  description: >
    OpenUDM has been used in a number of contexts to explore urban development scenarios.
    For example, this interactive article about urban development in the Oxford-Cambridge Arc introduces the modelling
    process and analyses the potential impacts of future development on the natural environment.
