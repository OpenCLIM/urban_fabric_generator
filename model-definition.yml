  summary: >
    OpenUDM is a grid cell-based model which explores where future urban development might take place, subject to
    attractors, constraints and variable density of development. The urban fabric generator model takes the .asc file 
    from the UDM model which defines where future urban development might take place, subject to attractors, constraints 
    and variable density of development and creates building and greenspace polygons determined by pre-selected critera 
    (housing types - detached, flats etc.).

  description: >
    OpenUDM has been used in a number of contexts to explore urban development scenarios. This urban fabric generator is a subset
    of the model, to reduce the size of the output files and focus on a specific area.
